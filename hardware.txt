lazik-alps:
Lazic et al propose a system that use a combination of ultrasound and Bluetooth to obtain precise localizatoin in small and medium sized areas using a TDOA. The system was designed using time synchronized ultrasonic signal 

Range-based approaches use measured distances or angular
estimates between known anchor points to compute a position.
Range-free approaches on the other hand typically attempt
to match either synthetic or naturally occurring signatures
to a particular location.
TOA and TDOF systems both require bidirectional
coordination between the infrastructure and the
device being tracked which generally limits scalability.

[An Ultrasonic Multiple-Access Ranging Core Based on
Frequency Shift Keying Towards Indoor Localization]
Our ultrasonic ranging system is composed of one receiver (Figure 1) and multiple transmitters.
The transmitters emit an orthogonal ultrasonic coded signal, which is received and processed by the
receiver. Both transmitters and receiver are equipped with an embedded FPGA, which has two major
purposes. On the one hand, it facilitates the generation of the orthogonal ultrasonic signal, while on the
other hand, due to the high degree of parallel processing capabilities, the FPGA enables the real-time
embedded processing of the orthogonal ultrasonic signals. Transmitters and receiver are synchronized
by means of a wire, which minimizes the synchronization error during the experiments.

 This is the basic idea of iterative
multilateration. 

[Distributed FPGA-based architecture to support indoor localisation and
orientation services]
one of the most promising approaches in
localisation/orientation of users in indoor environments is the
analysis of video streaming from the consumer electronic devices
that users carry

[Gradient-Based Fingerprinting for Indoor
Localization and Tracking]
Localization can be achieved by
performing lookups within a pre-established database. On the
basis of basic fingerprinting, Horus [46] adopts a probabilitybased
inference model, where the RSSI from an AP is modeled
into a random variable in both time and spatial domains
Another issue of fingerprinting is the time-varying signal
strength and biased observations reported by heterogeneous
devices 

[GSM indoor localization]
This paper demonstrated that accurate indoor GSM-based localization is possible
thanks to the use of wide signal-strength fingerprints that include readings of up to 29
GSM channels in addition to the 6-strongest cells. We also showed that the localization
performance can be further improved by carefully selecting a subset of highly relevant
channels to be used for fingerprinting matching.
