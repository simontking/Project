[Improving the accuracy of ultrasound-based localisation systems] 
We use a modified
BPSK demodulator (see Fig. 5) to limit the demand
for computational power. First, the received signal is
transformed from a pass band signal to a base band
signal by the quadrature mixer. The signal is split into
an in-phase and a quadrature component. Before a
data reduction stage, the signals are low-pass filtered.
The resulting signals are correlated with the stored
Barker code using the schema in Fig. 6. These modifications
to the BPSK demodulator reduce the computational
requirements to about 10 MIPS. Of course,
these modifications degrade accuracy. The overall
accuracy we experienced is well within our requirements
(see Sect. 4.2). The resulting signal of the receiver
is an envelope, showing how good the received
signal matches the stored signal. The best match and
thus the time of arrival of the signal can be easily
determined by a search for the global maximum.

. This problem shows that
a search for the global maximum cannot be used in
practice. We are working on a heuristic method to find
the first peak in the envelope.
Subsequently, sending a 13-chip Barker code and
waiting several milliseconds for it to fade away yields
an update rate that is comparable to the method of
simultaneously sending long codes. The increased effort
in decoding simultaneously sent ultrasound signals
does not achieve enough improvement to justify itself.
