The MIT cricket [The
cricket location-support system.] localization
system uses the difference between RF and ultrasonic
signals. The system is capable of extremely accurate
range measurements, but requires line-of-sight communication,
careful node positioning and high node density. It also
requires tight synchronization between the infrastructure and
the mobile devices.

since the ultrasonic signal is a pulse, the systems are
allowed to have only one active ultrasonic transmitter at a given timeslot. This principle is also known
as time division multiple access (TDMA)

Ultrasonic Beacon Firmware: Each Ultrasonic Beacon
synchronizes with the Network Master over a single hop
using its 802.15.4 radio. Once the beacon is synchronized,
it plays back the ultrasonic signal stored in its flash memory
at the beginning of its designated TDMA slot.

[Analysis of the Frequency Offset Effect on Zadoff-Chu Sequence Timing
Performance]
Signals providing good timing estimation must possess a good autocorrelation property [1]. Wireless
communication systems almost unexceptionally employ sequences that have good autocorrelation properties
to fulfill such a goal.
A ZC sequence is well known for its perfect autocorrelation properties. As a result, ZC sequences have
found their wide applications in modern cellular systems as synchronization sequences, such as the LTE
Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS) and the Random Access Channel (RACH) signal. However, the perfect
time autocorrelation is in general not true in practical applications when a frequency synchronization error is
present between the transmitter and the receiver. That is, the perfect autocorrelation property is lost under
non-zero frequency offset, consequently degrading the timing performance of a ZC sequence. The severity of
the degradation depends on both the root parameter of a ZC sequence and the time uncertainty
