The MIT cricket [The
cricket location-support system.] localization
system uses the difference between RF and ultrasonic
signals. The system is capable of extremely accurate
range measurements, but requires line-of-sight communication,
careful node positioning and high node density. It also
requires tight synchronization between the infrastructure and
the mobile devices.

since the ultrasonic signal is a pulse, the systems are
allowed to have only one active ultrasonic transmitter at a given timeslot. This principle is also known
as time division multiple access (TDMA)

Ultrasonic Beacon Firmware: Each Ultrasonic Beacon
synchronizes with the Network Master over a single hop
using its 802.15.4 radio. Once the beacon is synchronized,
it plays back the ultrasonic signal stored in its flash memory
at the beginning of its designated TDMA slot.
