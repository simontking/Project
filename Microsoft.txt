lessons learned
With this in mind, we organized the Microsoft Indoor Localization Competition [1].
The main motivation behind the competition was to give different academic and industry
groups the opportunity to test their indoor location technologies in a realistic, unfamiliar
environment. This environment established a common baseline for assessing the relative
accuracy and overhead of the different indoor location technologies. At the same time, it
allowed researchers working on the indoor location to meet and interact with each other,
and closely observe the competing solutions in action.

Hoppe
smartphone tracking
TDOA
multiple recievers mounted
phone emits pulses
receivers record and send to server for processing

Hammer
TOF
CSS
hyperbolic frequency modulated signal (HFM) UWB probably
First peak picking to account for MPE
fm radio synchronisation

perez cruz
TDOA
Devices emits reference signal
RF (2.4GHz)
receivers measure ToA
Mulrilateration using ToA measurements

zhi wang
3d
Combines TDOA and TOA
beacons connected over wifi
beacons calibrated manually(boo)
linear frequency modulated signal which is CSS i guess
